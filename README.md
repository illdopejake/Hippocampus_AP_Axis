# Hippocampus_AP_Axis

All code used for the Hippocampus Anterior/Posterior gene expression analyses from the paper [LINK TO PAPER COMING SOON]. 

Included are several Jupyter notebooks running through each of the analyses in the paper, showing the exact code and data used to prepare and run each analysis, and generate the figures from the manuscript. The repository also includes a library containing functions built specifically for these analyses, as well as some data.

I tried to go through and make the code as readable as possible (including some documentation), while still keeping the code as close as possible to the actual code I ran when doing these analyses the first time.

Additional in-depth documentation and information to come....
